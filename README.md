# DynamicAgent
DynamicAgent implements a way to 'save' a .NET method as a JSON string, and utilize DynamicMethods to deserialize the JSON and execute the method.  
  
**Note:** This is a little PoC to demonstrate the concept of DynamicMethods, and it probably doesn't cover all edge cases when converting a regular method to a DynamicMethod.
